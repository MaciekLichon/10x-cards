# Repository Guidelines

This is an Astro 6 application using React 19 islands, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Supabase authentication, and the Cloudflare Workers adapter. Product and stack decisions live in `@context/foundation/prd.md` and `@context/foundation/tech-stack.md`.

## Critical Rules

- Never modify `context/archive/`; archived changes are immutable. Open a new change instead.
- Keep secrets out of Git. Copy `@.env.example` to `.env` and `.dev.vars`, then provide `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY` locally or through CI/Cloudflare secrets.
- Update `PROTECTED_ROUTES` in `@src/middleware.ts` when a new page requires authentication; do not duplicate route protection inside page components.

## Project Structure

- `src/pages/` contains file-based pages; auth endpoints live in `src/pages/api/auth/`.
- `src/components/` contains shared Astro components and React components. Auth UI is grouped under `src/components/auth/`; reusable primitives live under `src/components/ui/`.
- `src/lib/` holds shared Supabase and configuration helpers, `src/layouts/` contains Astro layouts, and `src/styles/global.css` is the global stylesheet.
- Static files belong in `public/`. Supabase local configuration belongs in `supabase/`. Project context and change artifacts belong in `context/`.

## Build and Development Commands

- `npm run dev` starts the local Astro server.
- `npm run lint` runs the type-aware ESLint configuration; `npm run lint:fix` applies safe fixes.
- `npm run format` formats supported files with Prettier and sorts Tailwind classes.
- `npm run build` creates the Cloudflare-targeted production build; `npm run preview` serves that build locally.

Run `npx astro sync`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run build` before opening a pull request. These are the checks enforced by `@.github/workflows/ci.yml` for `master`.

## Coding Style and Naming

Use two-space indentation, semicolons, double quotes, trailing commas, and a 120-character line width per `@.prettierrc.json`. Name React and Astro components in PascalCase (`SignInForm.tsx`, `Topbar.astro`); use lowercase route filenames (`signin.astro`, `signup.ts`). Import application code through the `@/` alias. Prefix intentionally unused parameters with `_` so ESLint accepts them.

## Testing and Contributions

No automated test runner or coverage threshold is configured. Treat lint and production build as the required validation gate, and add a documented test script before introducing tests.

Recent commits use the course pattern `m1l<lesson> - <scope>` (for example, `m1l3 - bootstrap`). Keep commits focused. Pull requests should summarize behavior changes, list validation commands, note environment or Supabase changes, and include screenshots for visible UI updates.

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit - Module 2, Lesson 3

Review AI-generated code before merge with the **implementation review chain**:

```
/10x-implement -> /10x-impl-review -> triage -> (/10x-lesson | fix | skip | disagree)
```

`/10x-impl-review` is the lesson focus. Review is a quality gate, not an instruction to fix every finding.

### Task Router - Where to start

| Skill | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| **Code review (lesson focus)** | |
| `/10x-impl-review <change-id>` | You have implemented code and want a structured review before merge. The skill checks plan adherence, scope discipline, safety and quality, architecture, pattern consistency, and success criteria, then presents findings for triage. |
| **Recurring lesson outcome** | |
| `/10x-lesson` | A finding reveals a recurring project rule or agent failure pattern. Record it in `context/foundation/lessons.md` instead of treating it as a one-off note. |

### Triage discipline

- Severity says how bad the finding is. Impact says how much the decision matters now.
- Valid outcomes: fix now, fix differently, skip, accept as risk, record as recurring rule (`/10x-lesson`), disagree.
- Fix critical findings. Do not burn hours on low-impact observations just because the agent found them.
- Conscious skipping of low-impact findings is a valid review outcome, not negligence.
- If you disagree with a finding, record why. Wrong agent reasoning is also signal.

### Review boundaries

- This lesson reviews implemented code. It does not create the plan, execute new phases, or teach CI review.
- Testing strategy and quality gates are introduced in Module 3.
- Do not use `/10x-contract` as a triage outcome in this lesson.

### Paths used by this lesson

- `context/changes/<change-id>/plan.md` - expected implementation contract
- `context/changes/<change-id>/reviews/` - review output
- `context/foundation/lessons.md` - recurring lessons

Skills must not write to `context/archive/`. Archived changes are immutable; if a resolved target path starts with `context/archive/`, abort with: "This change is archived. Open a new change with `/10x-new` instead."
