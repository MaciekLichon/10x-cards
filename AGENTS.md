# Repository Guidelines

This is an Astro 6 application using React 19 islands, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Supabase authentication, and the Cloudflare Workers adapter. Product and stack decisions live in `@context/foundation/prd.md` and `@context/foundation/tech-stack.md`.

## Critical Rules

- Never modify `context/archive/`; archived changes are immutable. Open a new change instead.
- Keep secrets out of Git. Copy `@.env.example` to `.env` and `.dev.vars`, then provide `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY` locally or through CI/Cloudflare secrets.
- Update `PROTECTED_ROUTES` in `@src/middleware.ts` when a new page requires authentication; do not duplicate route protection inside page components.

## Project Structure

- `src/pages/` contains file-based pages; auth endpoints live in `src/pages/api/auth/`.
- `src/components/` contains shared Astro components and React components. Auth UI is grouped under `src/components/auth/`; reusable primitives live under `src/components/ui/`.
- `src/lib/` holds shared Supabase and configuration helpers, `src/layouts/` contains Astro layouts, and `src/styles/global.css` is the global stylesheet.
- Static files belong in `public/`. Supabase local configuration belongs in `supabase/`. Project context and change artifacts belong in `context/`.

## Build and Development Commands

- `npm run dev` starts the local Astro server.
- `npm run lint` runs the type-aware ESLint configuration; `npm run lint:fix` applies safe fixes.
- `npm run format` formats supported files with Prettier and sorts Tailwind classes.
- `npm run build` creates the Cloudflare-targeted production build; `npm run preview` serves that build locally.

Run `npx astro sync`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run build` before opening a pull request. These are the checks enforced by `@.github/workflows/ci.yml` for `master`.

## Coding Style and Naming

Use two-space indentation, semicolons, double quotes, trailing commas, and a 120-character line width per `@.prettierrc.json`. Name React and Astro components in PascalCase (`SignInForm.tsx`, `Topbar.astro`); use lowercase route filenames (`signin.astro`, `signup.ts`). Import application code through the `@/` alias. Prefix intentionally unused parameters with `_` so ESLint accepts them.

## Testing and Contributions

No automated test runner or coverage threshold is configured. Treat lint and production build as the required validation gate, and add a documented test script before introducing tests.

Recent commits use the course pattern `m1l<lesson> - <scope>` (for example, `m1l3 - bootstrap`). Keep commits focused. Pull requests should summarize behavior changes, list validation commands, note environment or Supabase changes, and include screenshots for visible UI updates.

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit - Module 2, Lesson 4

Prepare for a harder implementation stream with the **research-backed planning chain**:

```
internal research (/10x-research) + external research (exa.ai, Context7) -> /10x-plan -> /10x-implement -> success
```

The lesson focus is distinguishing internal from external research and using evidence to back planning decisions.

### Task Router - Where to start

| Skill | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| **Internal research (lesson focus)** | |
| `/10x-research <change-id>` | You need evidence from the existing codebase — patterns, conventions, integration points, or existing implementations. Runs parallel sub-agents over the repo and writes structured findings to `research.md`. |
| **External research (lesson focus)** | |
| exa.ai | You need AI-native web search for library comparisons, best practices, or ecosystem context that the codebase cannot answer. |
| Context7 (`resolve-library-id` → `get-library-docs`) | You need live, current documentation for a specific library or framework. Resolves a library ID first, then fetches relevant doc pages. |
| **Framing spare wheel** | |
| `/10x-frame <change-id>` | The plan won't converge, the plan doesn't deliver expected results, or persistent drift keeps breaking the implementation. Use as an escape hatch on a separate problem (demonstrated on Space Explorers example), not as pre-research ritual. |
| **Planning and execution** | |
| `/10x-plan <change-id>` / `/10x-implement <change-id> phase <n>` | Use the same planning and execution chain from Lesson 2, now with upstream research evidence feeding the plan. |

### Research discipline

- Internal research (`/10x-research`) answers "what does our codebase already do?" — patterns, schemas, conventions, integration points.
- External research (exa.ai, Context7) answers "what should we do?" — library capabilities, API docs, ecosystem best practices.
- Combine both as evidence-backed input to `/10x-plan`. A plan without research evidence on a non-trivial stream is a guess.
- Agent-friendly docs (`llms.txt`, markdown-for-agents, `/md` endpoints) are a quality signal for library selection — libraries that publish agent-readable docs integrate faster.

### `/10x-frame` as spare wheel

Three triggers for reaching for `/10x-frame`:
1. The plan won't converge — research keeps opening more questions instead of narrowing to a contract.
2. The plan doesn't deliver — implementation repeatedly fails to meet success criteria.
3. Persistent drift — the implementation keeps diverging from the plan in ways that suggest the problem was mis-framed.

Demonstrated on a Space Explorers example, not the SRS path. It is an escape hatch, not a mandatory step.

### Paths used by this lesson

- `context/changes/<change-id>/research.md` - internal research output
- `context/changes/<change-id>/frame.md` - framing output when needed
- `context/changes/<change-id>/plan.md` - evidence-backed implementation contract
- `context/foundation/lessons.md` - recurring rules and pitfalls

Skills must not write to `context/archive/`. Archived changes are immutable; if a resolved target path starts with `context/archive/`, abort with: "This change is archived. Open a new change with `/10x-new` instead."
